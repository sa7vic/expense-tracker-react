# 💸 Expense Tracker (React)

A simple single-page **Expense Tracker** built using **React** as part of my learning journey. This beginner project helps manage and track your income and expenses with a clean and minimal UI.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add new transactions (income or expense)
- ✅ View your **current balance**
- ✅ See a breakdown of **total income** and **total expenses**
- ✅ View your **transaction history**
- ✅ Delete individual transactions
- ✅ Comes with **4 default transactions** (you can delete them)
- 🚫 Data is **not stored** — refreshing the page resets everything

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **React** (Functional Components & Hooks)
- **Basic CSS** for styling

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo and run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker-react.git
cd expense-tracker-react
npm install
npm start
```
---

## ⚠️ Notes
- This is a beginner practice project
- It uses React state only — no database, no backend, no authentication
- All data is lost on refresh (no persistence)

---

## 📚 Learnings
- Learned how to manage state using useState
- Built components and passed props
- Practiced conditional rendering and list rendering in React

---

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
