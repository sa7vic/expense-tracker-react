# 💸 Expense Tracker (React)

A simple single-page **Expense Tracker** built using **React** as part of my learning journey. This beginner project helps manage and track your income and expenses with a clean and minimal UI — and a touch of fun with emoji suggestions!

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add new transactions (income or expense)
- ✅ View your **current balance**
- ✅ See a breakdown of **total income** and **total expenses**
- ✅ View your **transaction history**
- ✅ Delete individual transactions
- ✅ Comes with **4 default sample transactions**
- 🧠 Typing common keywords like `coff` or `rent` will auto-suggest 🧾 expense categories (e.g., `☕ Coffee`, `🏠 Rent`)
- 🚫 Data is **not stored** — refreshing the page resets everything

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **React** (Functional Components & Hooks)
- **Basic CSS** for styling

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo and run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sa7vic/expense-tracker-react.git

## ⚠️ Notes

* This is a beginner practice project

* All data is lost on refresh
* Emoji suggestions are simple keyword-based substitutions (not AI/autocomplete)
